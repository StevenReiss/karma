Karma implement a dummy run time environment for fait.	It should be cloned or installed along with fait (and
faitbb and fredit) before any of them is compiled.  While it can be compiled separately (run ant in the
top level or in any of the source directories), it is usually build by running ant at the top level of
fait which includes faitbb in the fait plugin.
